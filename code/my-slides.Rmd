## Cockle Clam Collection

These data are associated with a sampling over the summer to determine the reproductive status of clams from different areas in Puget Sound. Currently we only have size data. [Watch a video](https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8c080c5d-7e85-49f3-846b-ab9b012116db) of a sampling event. All images are located [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-cockle-repro)

## Pretty clams

There are couple of ways to include an image easily.
One is markdown it from a url 

![clam](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/dissect-measure_-_11.jpeg_30244032_2020-11-24_09-03-15.png)


## Local image

Another way is 

```
![label](relative/path/to/file)
```
![clam](../img/myclam.png)


## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
